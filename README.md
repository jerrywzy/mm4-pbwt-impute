# Imputation Pipeline using Minimac4 and PBWT

## Introduction

This is an in-house imputation pipeline for the genotype imputation of Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian datasets on the 1000G, HRC and SG10K reference panels. The pipeline uses Eagle2 for pre-phasing; Minimac4 and PBWT for genotype imputation; and  PLINK, VCFtools and BCFtools for general handling and quality control of the data. The pipeline outputs a table containing quality control SNPs, minor allele frequencies and imputation quality scores.
